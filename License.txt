#GitHUB Original MIT Licence informations concerning Amos Professional AGA (The X Project)

With the fact that I made several changes (huge works), I had the choice to decide to :
1. Makes the Amos Professional AGA (The X Project) remaining closed-source project, with a new license term of my choice (MIT Licence allow this)
2. Makes the Amos Professional AGA (The X Project) being Open Sourced MIT license like the Original François Lionet Amos Professional.

I did choose the 2nd option. So here is the LICENSE terms :
